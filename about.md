Hi, I'm Joe.

- I found Roblox in 2007. There I learned how to build and program things.
- I studied Math and Computer Science at the University of Marlyand, focusing on computational geometry and game engines.
- I started working on Roblox's engine professionally in 2016. I'm still doing that today.
- I still make things on Roblox because I love it.
