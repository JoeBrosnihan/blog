Hi, I'm Joe.

I found Roblox in 2007. There I learned how to build and program things.
I studied Math and Computer Science at the University of Marlyand, focusing on game engines and computational geometry.
I started working on Roblox's game engine in 2016. I'm still doing that today.
I still make Roblox games to explore various ideas.
