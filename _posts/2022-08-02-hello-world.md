Hi, I'm Joe. I do a bunch of things, many related to software and virtual worlds. I'm creating a blog to talk about some of these things.

Recently I've done a lot of technical work on [Bloxel](https://www.roblox.com/games/1427028360/Bloxel) that I want to write about. I've also learned a lot about player agency and emergence from working on [BIRD](https://www.roblox.com/games/3633505977/BIRD) that I'd like to write about at some point.
